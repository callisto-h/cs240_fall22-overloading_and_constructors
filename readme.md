Hello!

Today we are going to practice overloading some operators.

Specifically, we will be overloading:
 '>>' (insertion)
 '<<' (extraction)

as they are the most challenging to implement.

I have also prepared a number of questions that would be great
to reason through together in groups. Feel free to ask questions,
and let me know if something is wrong/confusing!

Answers are in the /answers folder. I have included my own overloaded operators, but there is no "correct" way to do it.

Compile with 'g++ main.cpp Sample.cpp'
